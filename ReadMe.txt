!!Run on Debug or Release x64!!

--Graphics--
There is 2 portals: static and dynamic with second textures
Some of objects are reflective
bloom and chromatic aberration as post-processing effects 


--Animation--
Instead of rolling I'm also made "strafe with casting spell" animation
since I'm going to use it for Game Jam

There is also "pushing" animation 
I've made all spheres ridiculously heavy, so try to push them!

Also I left debugging lines for ray cast
